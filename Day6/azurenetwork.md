### Azure Application Gateway & WAF
- **Azure Application Gateway** is like a smart traffic controller for your website. It makes sure that website visitors are directed to the right servers so that no single server gets overloaded.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** acts like a security guard for your web applications, protecting them from common threats like hackers.

### Azure Load Balancer
- The **Azure Load Balancer** is similar to the Application Gateway but for more general network traffic. It spreads out traffic across multiple servers to prevent any one server from getting too much work.

### Azure DNS
- **Azure DNS** is a service that manages your website's address (like www.example.com) and makes sure it points to the right location. It works globally, so no matter where your visitors are, they’ll quickly get to your site.

### Azure Firewall
- **Azure Firewall** is a security system that protects your Azure resources by blocking or allowing traffic based on set rules. It can also filter traffic by looking at specific website addresses and is integrated with tools that warn about potential threats.

### Virtual Network Peering and VNet Gateway
- **Virtual Network Peering** connects different virtual networks (like connecting two offices), so resources in one network can talk to resources in another without any extra steps.
- **VNet Gateway** is a secure bridge between your company’s network and Azure, allowing you to connect them over the internet safely.

### VPN Gateway
- **Azure VPN Gateway** is like a secure tunnel that connects your company’s network to Azure over the internet, ensuring all data transferred is protected.

This is a broad overview, but these tools help manage and secure your network and web traffic in Azure.
